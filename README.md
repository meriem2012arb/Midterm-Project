Goal : 
Our objective is to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke (Target feature : ```stroke``` (0/1)) based on the features from given data using ML techniques.

Data :
The dataset dowloaded is  from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

### Attribute Information :
```
